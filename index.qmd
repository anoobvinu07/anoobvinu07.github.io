[Hi there! I'm Anoob Prakash]{style="font-size: 2.6rem; font-weight: 600; display: block; margin-bottom: 0.25rem; color: #b82601;"}

[Welcome to my personal website. I’m a researcher working at the intersection of ecological and evolutionary genomics, climate adaptation, and bioinformatics. I am interested in applying data science skills to analyze large-scale genomic datasets to understand how tree species respond to changing climate. Learn more [about me](about/about.qmd) on this site, you’ll find my research, projects (data visualization and analysis) and interests.]{style="font-size: 1.6rem; font-weight: 400; display: block; margin-bottom: 0.25rem; color: #6fb3b8;"}
