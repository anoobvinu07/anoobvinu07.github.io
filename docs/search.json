As a consequence of weak reproductive barriers, members of different species can interbreed in nature. When hybrids between two species are fertile, hybrids may then interbreed with members of the original species in a process known as backcrossing. Multiple generations of hybridization and subsequent backcrossing can facilitate the exchange of genetic material between parental species, a process known as introgression. Much of the research conducted in the Keller lab aims to understand if this exchange of genetic material is an adaptive process. For example, does genetic variation that increases tolerance to environmental stress in one species play the same role when it is introgressed into another species?\nOne current area of interest in the Keller lab is the susceptibility of hybrid poplars to infection by rust fungi in the genus Melampsora. One overarching question in the lab that this work addresses is the relationship between hybridization and local adaptation. The potential roles of ancestry and adaptation to local climatic variables as indicators of disease susceptibility in common garden experiments are being investigated."

    "text": "Genomic Forecasting\nStatus: Ongoing\nPublications: Lachmuth et al. (2024) in Ecological Monographs\n\n\n\n\nGenomic forecasting workflow. \n\nForecasting the responses of populations to climate change is a complex but important issue to understand as we face the potential for widespread climate maladaptation in the coming decades. This hits especially hard for long-lived, sessile organisms like forest trees, whose long-generation times and limited dispersal potential constrain the ability to adapt or track shifting climate. Recently, there has been increasing interest in combining genomics with climate models to forecast the short-term impacts of climate change on population adaptation. Our lab, in close collaboration with Matt Fitzaptrick’s lab has been developing computational approaches to predict short-term disruption of climate adaptation, known as “genomic offset” modelling. Since first introducing the concept and statistical framework for genomic offset in 2015 (Fitzpatrick and Keller, 2015), we have worked to refine and extend the scope and application of offset models to predicting climate change maladaptation. This has involved simulation testing of genomic offset predictions, in collaboration with Katie Lotterhos’ lab, as well as testing the sensitivity of offset models to model choices such as the genomic loci used and the climate variables and future projection scenarios (Lachmuth et al., 2023).\nIn addition to building and refining the computational pipeline of genomic offset for forecasting climate change responses, our lab has been working on empirical testing of offset predictions, using a space-for-time approach that evaluates the effect of transferring genotypes from their source climate into one or more common garden sites, and predicting growth and fitness-traits from genomic offsets calculated between the source and garden site climates. Using poplar trees as a study system, we provided the first such common garden test of offset predictions, showing a strong negative response of growth with increasing genomic offset (Fitzpatrick et al. 2021). We have recently shown a similar result in red spruce (Picea rubens) across 3 seedling common gardens (Lachmuth et al., 2023), as well as in a 60 year old red spruce provenance trial in northern New Hampshire (Verrico et al., in prep.)."

Red spruce provides timber, critical habitat for rare and endemic wildlife species, and recreational value to humans. Our lab has explored how population size, range limits, and genetic diversity have impacted local adaptation to climate across red spruce’s range (Capblancq et al., 2020, Capblancq et al., 2021, Prakash et al, 2022 )\n\n\n\n\n\nRed spruce stands in Colebrooke, NH \n\n\nSpruce regeneration monitoring in West Virginia. \n\nHybridization and adaptive introgression\nFor long-lived species with low genetic diversity, introgression—the transfer of genetic material from one lineage into the genome of another through repeated backcrossing—can be a powerful source of adaptive variation in the face of climate change. Red spruce hybridizes with its sister species black spruce (Picea mariana), and most red spruce trees found in the overlap between the two species’ ranges derive significant portions of their genome from past hybridization with black spruce. Recent work by our lab suggests that introgression from black spruce plays a key role in supporting red spruce’s capacity to adapt to climate gradients across its range Prakash et al. (in prep). We use a combination of spatial modeling and landscape and population genomics to characterize the spatial and temporal natural history of hybridization, understand the role of selection in preserving introgressed regions of the genome, and determine under what conditions this introgression may be adaptive. We are also establishing a provenance trial of red and black spruce hybrids, which will serve as a long-term resource for linking the genomics of hybridization with adaptive traits.\nApplied conservation\nOne of our lab’s major goals is to disseminate the findings of the scientific research to the broader community to inform conservation and restoration efforts on the ground. Red spruce is a species of conservation concern due to high climate change vulnerability and is the focus of several major restoration initiatives, notably the Central Appalachian Red Spruce Restoration Initiative (CASRI) and the Southern Appalachian Red Spruce Restoration Initiative (SASRI), which have planted tens of thousands of seedlings supported by The Nature Conservancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed spruce restoration in collaboration with CASRI and TNC\n\n\n\n\n\nKathryn Shallows from TNC approached the Keller lab in 2019 regarding red spruce restoration towards the southern range edge of its distribution, mainly in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. This led to a larger partnership that culminated in genomic assisted seed source selection for the restoration initiative at these sites. Instead of opting for a single source restoration initiative, we used a multiple seed source approach to improve the genetic diversity of the restoration stands to withstand the changing climate and environmental stressors. This source selection was carried out in the light of research done by Keller lab using the exome capture data and the common gardens set up at Vermont, Maryland and North Carolina. Three to four sources combinations per restoration site were selected for high genetic diversity and low genetic load.\n\nCapblancq et al. (2021) has observed that early-life fitness of the red spruce had strong positive association with genetic diversity and negative association with genetic load, especially for the southern range edge of the red spruce distribution range. These seed source combinations were used as a recommendation list to Dave Seville (CASRI) to assess the seed production situation on the ground and raise them in the nursery for the restoration initiative. In 2021, TNC planted 58,000 red spruce seedlings at the restoration sites. Keller lab then carried out the restoration monitoring of these restoration sites in 2022, a whole year after the seedlings had been planted in the ground to assess the success of genomic assisted restoration of red spruce. Using this information, Prakash et al. (2024) found that there were no “Super Seed Source” that outperformed other seed sources and the combination of seed sources outperformed any single source for the restoration success.\n\n\n\nGenomic assisted red spruce restoration at Maryland, West-Viginia and Virginia, USA."

    "text": "I’m a plant biologist and forest genomicist who spends a lot of time thinking about how trees will cope with a rapidly changing climate. I work at the intersection of ecological and evolutionary genomics, climate science, and data science, using large genomic and environmental datasets to understand – and hopefully help guide – the future of forests.\n\n\nMost of my research asks a simple but hard question: how will tree species respond to climate change, and what can we do about it?\nDuring my PhD at the University of Vermont with Dr. Stephen R. Keller, I focused on red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.). I combined genomics, climate data, and trait measurements from common gardens to study genotypic and phenotypic variation, local adaptation, and the role of introgression with black spruce (Picea mariana). Along the way, I managed three common gardens, ran GWAS to identify adaptive loci, and spent a lot of time turning messy datasets into interpretable stories.\nThat work led to collaborations with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration initiative (CASRI). Together, we used genomic information to select seed sources for restoration in the southern range edge of red spruce, which ultimately informed the planting of ~58,000 seedlings across West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. It was a satisfying example of science’s real world impact.\n\n\n\nI’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University, working with Dr. Matthew Ginzel and Dr. Vikram Chhatre. Here, I’m extending the same ideas to black walnut, white oak, and shortleaf pine – species with high restoration potential and major ecological and economic importance. I use machine-learning approaches to detect climate pre‑adaptation and mal‑adaptation, and to identify seed sources that are likely to perform well in future climates. A big goal of this work is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners so restoration and reforestation projects can make informed, climate‑savvy seed sourcing decisions.\n\n\n\nBefore moving into conifers and temperate forests, my master’s work in India focused on something more immediate and local: particulate pollution. Near the Walayar Cement Factory, I studied how dust pollution affects growth, physiology, and wood anatomy of moist deciduous tree species, and which species might be more resilient. That early work shaped my interest in how environmental stressors leave signatures in plant physiology.\nOver the years, I’ve also invested heavily in data skills and open, quantitative science. As an NSF Research Trainee in the Biological Data Science (BilDS) program (formerly QuEST), I collaborated across disciplines at UVM and learned to use quantitative tools to tackle environmental and global health questions. As part of this program, I interned with TNC on large‑scale reforestation planning, which closely aligned with my dissertation work and showed me how genomic data can support real‑world decisions.\nI was also a USDA GradCAMP Climate scholar, participating in a year-long, cohort-based experience focused on climate adaptation, mitigation, and climate justice. That year involved interdisciplinary research, networking with climate professionals, and science communication, including developing “forests of the future” factsheets. At UVM, I served two years as a graduate student senator for Plant Biology, working on issues related to graduate stipends, mental health, and governance.\n\n\n\nScientifically, I’m drawn to climate change adaptation, population and landscape genomics, environmental data science, and transparent, reproducible workflows. I enjoy projects that sit at the interface of fundamental evolutionary questions and applied conservation or restoration decisions.\nOutside of research, you’ll usually find me on a basketball court, tinkering with data visualizations, learning new illustration tools, or playing games. I enjoy the creative side of science communication – turning complex models and genomic results into visuals and narratives that are intuitive for both scientists and non‑scientists."
