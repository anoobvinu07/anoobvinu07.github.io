Investigated the impact of particulate pollution on growth, physiology, and anatomical properties of *Tectona grandis* and other moist deciduous tree species near industrial sites.

- Assessed chlorophyll content, ascorbic acid levels, relative water content, and leaf pH to evaluate air pollution tolerance across seasons.
- Analyzed dust accumulation, leaf surface area, leaf area index, and leaf area duration to quantify pollution effects on tree health and productivity.
- Compared wood anatomical properties of pollution-exposed and control populations, identifying significant differences in wood quality and structure.

#### Independent Undergraduate Researcher – Kerala, India (2010–2011)

- Characterized structural and functional attributes of home gardens and developed recommendations for integrated farming systems for medium and large-scale farmers.
